# Whirly Birdie and Whirlybats Variable Font

This is a project template for [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) apps. It lives at https://github.com/sveltejs/template.


## Get started

Remix this app on Glitch and you should be ready to go!

When the Glitch runs `npm run build`, this app uses rollup to package everything.

When `npm run start` is run, this app uses [sirv](https://github.com/lukeed/sirv) to serve the static site.


```js
"start": "sirv public --single"
```
